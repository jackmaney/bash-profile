bash-profile
============

A bare-bones .bash\_profile so that I can remember how to get my `PS1`
output how I like it.

Prerequisites:

-   [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)
-   [Solarized-Dark color
    theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) for iTerm2.
-   [vcprompt](https://github.com/djl/vcprompt) for grabbing git repo
    statuses (note that although `vcprompt` isn't under active
    development, it seems to work well enough. Follow the instructions
    in the README to install `vcprompt`).
-   [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) and
    [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv). Both
    of these are easily installed via HomeBrew. Note that the
    `.bash_profile` snippet that's included takes care of running the
    `init` commands for both of these packages.
-   The pieces within this `.bash_profile` (that's bare-bones and
    pertain to nifty colorized output).
