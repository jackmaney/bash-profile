bash-profile
============

A bare-bones .bash_profile so that I can remember how to get my `PS1` output how I like it.

Prerequisites:

-	[iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)
-	[Solarized-Dark color theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) for iTerm2.
-	[vcprompt](https://github.com/djl/vcprompt) for grabbing git repo statuses (note that although `vcprompt` isn't under active development, it seems to work well enough. Follow the instructions in the README to install `vcprompt`).
-	The pieces within this `.bash_profile` (that's bare-bones and pertain to nifty colorized output).
